NOTE:
1. All the files that are generated by programs are in folder output/

ATTRIBUTES:
1. N is total number of points to be generated : TRAINING + TEST
2. r is no_of_training_points/no_of_total_points and 0 < r < 1
3. M is complexity of model
4. L is LAMBHDA used in ridge regression, provide x100 value of L as it is divided by 100 in program
5. m1 lower limit of M
6. m2 upper limit of M
7. n1 lower limit of N
8. n2 upper limit of N
9. l1 lower limit of L
10. l2 upper limit of L
